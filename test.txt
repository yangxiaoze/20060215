When I was young I'd listen to the radio
Waitin' for my favorite songs
When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile

Lookin' back on how it was in years gone by
And the good times that I had
Makes today seem rather sad, so much has changed.

Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling, that they're startin' to sing's so fine
Every sha-la-la-la
Every wo-o-wo-o, still shines
Every shing-a-ling-a-ling
